# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates an issue where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied across components. The issue is intermittent and doesn't have a clear pattern of reproduction, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description
Some Tailwind utility classes seem to be ignored or applied incorrectly in certain instances. This inconsistency makes it hard to style components reliably.  The problem doesn't appear to be related to specific classes or components but rather occurs randomly.

## Solution
The proposed solution involves several steps to ensure Tailwind is correctly processing the CSS.  This includes verifying the Tailwind configuration, cleaning the build process, and thoroughly checking for any conflicting styles or CSS overrides.
