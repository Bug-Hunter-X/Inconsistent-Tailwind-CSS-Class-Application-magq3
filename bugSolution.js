```javascript
// Verify Tailwind Configuration
// Ensure your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js) is correctly set up and includes all the necessary paths.
// Check that the purge or content option is pointing to the right locations
// Clean the build process.  Sometimes cached files can cause unexpected issues.
// Recompile your CSS and restart your development server.
// Thoroughly inspect the generated CSS file to make sure the class you're using exists and hasn't been accidentally purged.
// Check for conflicting CSS rules or styles in your project that might override Tailwind's styling.
// Try adding !important (as a last resort) to the problematic style to see if it's being overridden.
// If the problem persists, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the issue further.
